                        <p>The news that Southern Vermont College will close saddens the MCLA community, and our thoughts are with all those who are affected by this news.  We offer our support and encouragement to SVC students – those currently enrolled, and those admitted to attend for the first time in fall 2019 – who may have questions about their educational options.

If you are a current SVC student who would like more information, please contact the MCLA Office of Admissions: 413-662-5410 or admissions@mcla.edu.

MCLA will waive all application fees and provide an expedited transfer process that will allow SVC students to seamlessly and quickly transfer to MCLA. MCLA will provide an admission decision within 24 hours of receiving a completed online application and all necessary supporting documents. MCLA will accept all currently matriculated students who are in good academic and judicial standing at SVC. 

MCLA will begin accepting applications from SVC students immediately.</p>
